/*Create Decimal Numbers with JavaScriptPassed
We can store decimal numbers in variables too. Decimal numbers are sometimes referred to as floating point numbers or floats.

Note: Not all real numbers can accurately be represented in floating point. This can lead to rounding errors. Details Here.

Create a variable myDecimal and give it a decimal value with a fractional part (e.g. 5.7). */


var ourDecimal = 5.7;

// Only change code below this line

var myDecimal =5.4;
