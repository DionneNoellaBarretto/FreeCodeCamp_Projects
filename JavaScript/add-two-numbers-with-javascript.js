Add Two Numbers with JavaScriptPassed
Number is a data type in JavaScript which represents numeric data.

Now let's try to add two numbers using JavaScript.

JavaScript uses the + symbol as an addition operator when placed between two numbers.

const myVar = 5 + 10;
myVar now has the value 15.

var sum = 10 + 10;
